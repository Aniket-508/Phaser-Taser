# Local Hack Day Build 2022 by MLH
This is my submission for creating a one-button game as a part of daily challenge of day 3 of this challenge.

## Rules of the game : 
- You control the green circle with the rotating arrow. Once you press/tap the screen, arrow will stop its rotation and your power starts charging. You can see your power in the upper left of the screen.

- Once you release touch/click on the screen, the green circle will move along arrow direction, according to the power you set.

- Collect yellow circles and avoid red circles or you will die.

- To restart the game, you can just refresh the page.
